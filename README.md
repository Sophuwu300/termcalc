# TermCalc
A simple calculator in c/c++ that works in the terminal.

I made this to allow me to do simple calculations in the terminal when I would cat sys hwmon files and wanted to do some quick math on the values.
It turned out to be useful and I often call it when I'm using other shells that don't have a calculator built in.
